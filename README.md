receiptbooth
============

Mobile photo booth using Bluetooth receipt printer and iPad or iPhone

This is originally based off Brad Larson's Color Tracking project ( http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/2010/10/22/gpu-accelerated-video-processing-mac-and-ios ) and was made for Halloween as fast as I could create it... so the code could use a LOT of cleaning up.
