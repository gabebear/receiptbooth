receiptbooth
============

Mobile photo booth using Bluetooth receipt printer and iPad or iPhone

The idea is to take 576pixel wide black adn white(no greyscale) images that will be directly printed to a thermal receipt printer.

The buttons on the left select the effect to apply and the "Print" button sends it to the printer and also saves it to the camera roll.

This works with the Star T300i printer only currently, but could easily work with other similar printers if modified. http://www.starmicronics.com/Printer/PrinterDesc.aspx?PageId=14&PrinterId=144

This is originally based off Brad Larson's Color Tracking project ( http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/2010/10/22/gpu-accelerated-video-processing-mac-and-ios ) and was made for Halloween as fast as I could create it... so the code could use a LOT of cleaning up.
